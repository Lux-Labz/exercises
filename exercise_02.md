## Introduction

In this guide, weâ€™ll create a basic script that displays the message "Hello, World!" when run. Youâ€™ll see just how easy it is to write and execute a simple script in Xubuntu, which is a user-friendly version of Linux.

## Step 1: Open the Terminal

Letâ€™s start by opening the terminal. This is where youâ€™ll type commands to interact with your system.

1. Click the **Applications Menu** in the top left corner of your screen.
2. Search for **Terminal** and click it to open.

You should now see a terminal window where you can enter your commands. Youâ€™re already on the right track!

## Step 2: Create a Hello World Script

Now that youâ€™ve got the terminal open, letâ€™s create the script.

1. In the terminal, type the following command to open a text editor called **nano**:
    ```bash
    nano hello_world.sh
    ```

2. You are now inside the nano editor. Type the following lines of code:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, World!"
    ```

3. Once youâ€™ve typed the code, press `CTRL + O` to save the file.
4. Hit `Enter` to confirm the file name.
5. Press `CTRL + X` to exit nano.

Awesome! Youâ€™ve just written your first script.

## Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Before you can run your script, you need to make it executable. This means giving it permission to run as a program.

1. In the terminal, type the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x hello_world.sh
    ```

This command gives the script the necessary permissions to be executed. Youâ€™re almost there!

## Step 4: Run the Script

Now for the exciting part â€” running your "Hello World" script!

1. In the terminal, type:
    ```bash
    ./hello_world.sh
    ```

You should see the following output:

Hello, World!
