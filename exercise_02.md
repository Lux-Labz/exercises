# Running a Hello World Python Script on Xubuntu - Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to this easy-to-follow guide on running a "Hello World" Python script in Xubuntu. Whether you're a beginner or just brushing up, you'll find all the steps you need here. Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Open the Terminal

The terminal is your way to communicate with your system via commands. To open the terminal in Xubuntu, follow one of these two methods:

1. **Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
2. **From Menu**: Click on the **whisker menu** (Xubuntu logo in the top-left corner), type "Terminal" in the search bar, and click to open it.

Now that the terminal is open, you're ready to begin!

## Step 2: Check if Python is Installed

Xubuntu typically comes with Python installed. Letâ€™s check if Python is available on your system. In the terminal, type the following command and hit `Enter`:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is installed, you'll see something like this:

```
Python 3.x.x
```

If Python is not installed, no worries! Just run these commands to install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

Once Python is installed, youâ€™re good to go!

## Step 3: Write Your "Hello World" Python Script

Letâ€™s create your first Python scriptâ€”a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" on the screen.

### Creating the File

1. In the terminal, type this command to open the `nano` text editor and create a new file called `hello_world.py`:

   ```bash
   nano hello_world.py
   ```

2. Now, write the following Python code inside `nano`:

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

3. To **save the file** in `nano`:
   - Press `Ctrl + O`.
   - Hit `Enter` to confirm the filename.

4. To **exit** `nano`:
   - Press `Ctrl + X`.

Great job! You've just written your first Python script!

## Step 4: Run Your Python Script

Now that youâ€™ve written the script, letâ€™s run it.

### Ensure You're in the Right Directory

Make sure youâ€™re in the same directory where your `hello_world.py` script is saved. To check your current directory, use:

```bash
pwd
```

If the script isnâ€™t in your current directory, navigate to the correct location using the `cd` command. For example, if you saved your file in the `Documents` folder, you would type:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

### Run the Script

To run your Python script, simply type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 hello_world.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, youâ€™ll see this output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Step 5: Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

You did it! You've successfully written and run your first Python script on Xubuntu. Take a moment to appreciate your achievement. ðŸŽŠ

## Troubleshooting Tips

Here are a few common issues and solutions you might run into:

- **Command not found error**: Make sure you're using `python3` and not just `python` when running your script.
- **File not found error**: Ensure you're in the same directory as your `hello_world.py` file. Use `ls` to list files in the current directory.
- **Permission denied error**: Make sure you have the correct permissions. You can try running the script with `sudo` if needed, but this shouldnâ€™t be necessary for basic Python scripts.

## Next Steps

Now that you've mastered running a Python script, what's next? Here are a few ideas to keep you going:

- Modify the script to print other messages.
- Experiment with using variables and simple calculations in your script.
- Learn more about Python fundamentals like loops, functions, and conditionals.

Python is a versatile language, and you've just taken the first step on an exciting journey. Keep coding and exploring new ideas!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
