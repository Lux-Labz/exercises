## Overview

In this exercise, you will learn the very basics of Python programming by writing your first program: "Hello World." This simple program will help you get familiar with writing code, saving files, and running Python on an Ubuntu system. By the end of this exercise, you will understand how to execute Python scripts and see the output directly in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, make sure you have the following:

1. A computer running **Ubuntu** (any recent version is fine).
2. **Python 3** installed. You can check by running `python3 --version` in the terminal.
3. A text editor installed, such as **VS Code**, **Gedit**, or **Nano**.
4. Basic familiarity with the terminal (opening it, navigating directories, running commands).

## Exercise: Python Hello World

Follow these steps carefully and in order:

### Step 1: Open the Terminal

* Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the terminal on Ubuntu.
* You will use this terminal to navigate directories and run Python commands.

### Step 2: Create a New Directory for Your Project

* Type the following command and press Enter:

  ```bash
  mkdir hello_world
  ```
* Change into the new directory:

  ```bash
  cd hello_world
  ```

### Step 3: Create a Python File

* Create a new Python file using your preferred text editor. For example, with Nano:

  ```bash
  nano hello.py
  ```
* This opens a blank file named `hello.py`.

### Step 4: Write Your First Python Program

* In the text editor, type the following line exactly:

  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
* This is a Python command that displays text on the screen.

### Step 5: Save the File

* In Nano, press `Ctrl + O` to save, then `Enter` to confirm.
* Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

### Step 6: Run Your Python Program

* Back in the terminal, run the program using:

  ```bash
  python3 hello.py
  ```
* You should see the output:

  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```

### Step 7: Celebrate Your Success!

* Youâ€™ve successfully written and run your first Python program!
* Try modifying the text inside the quotes and re-run the program to see different outputs.

## Summary

In this exercise, you:

* Learned how to open a terminal and navigate directories.
* Created a Python file and wrote your first program.
* Learned how to save and run a Python script on Ubuntu.
* Saw the output of your Python program in the terminal.

Congratulations on taking your first step into programming!

## Follow-Up

1. Modify the `hello.py` file to print your name or a favorite quote.
2. Explore more Python functions like `input()` to ask the user for input.
3. Read more beginner tutorials at [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) or [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).
4. Try creating multiple small Python programs to strengthen your understanding.

If you want, I can also create a **visual diagram of this workflow** showing the terminal commands, file creation, and program execution to make it even easier for students to follow. Do you want me to do that next?
